# Joel Vandiver's Blog

I intend to use this blog *for* learning.  I do not seek to teach for teaching's sake, but rather I teach *to learn*.  

## To Teach is To Learn

> I found the best way to learn something is to teach it.  

I thought I knew Mathematics after I graduated college, but I've never been more lost than standing in front of 30 high school students trying to teach them Algebra I.  I had already completed Cal I, II, & III, Diff. Eq., and Linear Algebra, and yet I struggled to convey basic concepts to them.  Sure, I could ace an Algebra I test - no problem - but I struggled to meet students where they were and in how they learned best. 

It took repetition in teaching and studying for me to unlock the richness of the subject so that I could meet the students where they were.  

## To Teach is To Explore

My goal in teaching is to discover new insights.  Explaining my thoughts forces me to dig deeper.  Without teaching (or in this case blogging), I would never really feel grounded in my learning day-to-day.

These guides serve as topics of interest to me over the last 10 years of my career as a software engineer.  

## About Me

I started coding in 2008 with JavaScript as a high school Math teacher.  I had been building a website for my students to learn from.  By this point, I had already flipped my classroom where students would learn from my online videos (see [my original youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/joelvandiver)) and then they completed "homework" in the classroom with me to help as their "tutor".  

The deeper I went with coding, the more successful I became at teaching.  I had gotten to the point where I started learning C++!  I figured, "Eh, anyone who's serious about coding has to learn C++."  

Then, an opportunity came my way to work professionally in software engineering.  I started my career in C# and SQL SERVER.  Day after day, I would slog through raw SQL queries as I learned to express my thoughts with code.  Then, I quickly sought to *automate* some of my work through an ASP.NET MVC app written in C#. After a few years, I brought JavaScript back to my daily routine with AngularJS and jQuery.  

Then, I had the opportunity to move into a position at a bigger company with a larger space to grow in.  I continued developing in C#, SQL SERVER, and JavaScript, but I quickly transitioned to using F# full-time.  

**I really love F#.**  There's something about it's syntax that feels more natural as a mathematician.  I spent several years just hanging out with F# and SQL SERVER.

But, then, in order to grow, I needed to move to a larger team with an even greater impact within the company.  Through this team, I've grafted in Python, TypeScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, and Docker (to name a few) into my development experience.  

**Now, I really love Python.**  I was surprised to learn that Python supports type annotations and comprehension expressions.  Both of these features are critical for functional programming.

My career has been a wild ride of constant learning, and I've got so much more to explore!

Enjoy!
