# Joel Vandiver's Blog

## Why Blog?

I intend to use this blog *for* learning.  

> I found the best way to learn something is to try and explain it.  

I thought I knew Mathematics after I graduated college, but I've never been more lost than standing in front of 30 high school students trying to teach them Algebra I.  I had already completed Cal I, II, & III, Diff. Eq., and Linear Algebra, and yet I struggled to convey basic concepts to them.  Sure, I could ace an Algebra I test - no problem - but I struggled to meet students where they were and in how they learned best. It took repetition in teaching and studying for me to unlock the richness of the subject so that I could meet the students where they were.  

## About Me

I started coding in 2008 with JavaScript as a high school Math teacher.  I began building a website for my students.  By this point, I had flipped my classroom where students would learn from my online videos (see [my original youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/joelvandiver)) and then they completed "homework" in the classroom with me to help as their tutor.  

The deeper I went with coding, the more successful I became at teaching Mathematics.  I began generating individualized tests based on abstract representations of Math problems and in various degrees of Number Theory.  I had even gotten to the point where I started learning C++!  I figured, "Eh, anyone who's serious about coding has to learn C++."  

Then, an opportunity came my way to work professionally in software engineering.  I started my career in .NET, C#, JS, and SQL SERVER.  Day after day, I would slog through raw SQL queries as I learned to express my questions with code.  I was shocked by the *impurities* of imperative languages such as C#, because coming from a Math background, I had exclusively written all code in a functional style.  

Later, I had the opportunity to move into a position at a bigger company with a larger space to grow in.  I have worked in various positions in the company, and I've had the opportunity to learn from other languages and frameworks.

- **C# .NET** Taught me object orientated programming, dependency injection, and a whole host of design patterns.
- **F# .NET** Taught me to rely on immutability by default, use functions as first-class values, and the benefits of minimizing side-effects.
- **TypeScript** Taught me that frontend development can be just as rigorous as the backend.
- **Docker** Taught me to formally define my application's environment and to explore other technologies.
- **Python** Taught me to get things done. I was surprised to learn that Python supports type annotations and comprehension expressions.
- **Rust** Taught me how to reason about memory and how to think of data structures at a systems level.

My career has been a wild ride of constant learning, and I've got so much more to explore!

Enjoy!
