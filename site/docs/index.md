> I found the best way to learn something is to try and explain it.  

I intend to use this blog *for* learning.  I started out my career as a high school Mathematics teacher.  I thought I *knew* Mathematics after I graduated college, but I've never been more lost than standing in front of 30 high school students trying to teach them Algebra I.  I had already completed Cal I, II, & III, Diff. Eq., and Linear Algebra, and yet I struggled to convey basic concepts to them.  Sure, I could ace an Algebra I test - no problem - but I struggled to meet students where they were and in how they learned best. It took repetition in teaching and studying for me to unlock the richness of the subject so that I could meet the students where they were.
