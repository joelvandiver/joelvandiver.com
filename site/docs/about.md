# About Me

I started programming in 2008 with JavaScript as a teacher to build a website for my students.  By this point, I had flipped my classroom where students would learn from my online videos (see [my original youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/joelvandiver)) and then they completed "homework" in the classroom with me to help as their tutor.  

The deeper I went with programming, the more successful I became at teaching Mathematics.  I began generating individualized tests based on abstract representations of Math problems.  I had even gotten to the point where I started learning C++!  I figured, "Eh, anyone who's serious about programming has to learn C++."  

Then, an opportunity came my way to work professionally as a programmer.  I started my career in .NET.  Day after day, I would slog through raw SQL queries as I learned to express my questions with code.  I was shocked by the *impurities* of imperative languages such as C#. Coming from a Math background, I had exclusively programmed in a functional style.  It wasn't until years later that I learned just how *impure* JS actually is.

Later, I had the opportunity to move into a position at a bigger company with a larger space to grow in.  Over time, I have worked in various positions in the company, and I've had the opportunity to learn from other languages and frameworks.

- **C# .NET** Taught me object orientated programming, dependency injection, and a whole host of design patterns.
- **F# .NET** Taught me to rely on immutability by default, use functions as first-class values, and the benefits of minimizing side-effects.
- **TypeScript** Taught me that types can be computable as well.
- **Python** Taught me to get things done and that even dynamic languages can support annotations.
- **Rust** Taught me how to reason about memory and how to think of data structures at a systems level.
- **Docker** Taught me to formally define my application's environment and to explore other technologies.
- **Kubernetes** Taught me to distribute my services to simplify development at scale.

My career has been a wild ride of constant learning, and I've got so much more to explore!

Enjoy!
