I started coding in 2008 with JavaScript as a high school Math teacher.  I had been building a website for my students to learn from.  By this point, I had already flipped my classroom where students would learn from my online videos (see [my original youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/joelvandiver)) and then they completed "homework" in the classroom with me to help as their "tutor".  

The deeper I went with coding, the more successful I became at teaching.  I had gotten to the point where I started learning C++!  I figured, "Eh, anyone who's serious about coding has to learn C++."  

Then, I got the opportunity to work professionally in software engineering.  I started my career in C# and SQL SERVER.  Day after day, I would slog through raw SQL queries as I learned to express my thoughts with code.  Then, I quickly sought to *automate* some of my work through an ASP.NET MVC app written in C#. After a few years, I brought JavaScript back to my daily routine with AngularJS and jQuery.  

Then, I had the opportunity to move into a position at a bigger company with a larger space to grow in.  I continued developing in C#, SQL SERVER, and JavaScript, but I quickly transitioned to using F# full-time.  

**I really love F#.**  There's something about it's syntax that feels more natural as a mathematician.  I spent several years just hanging out with F# and SQL SERVER.

But, then, in order to grow, I needed to move to a larger team with an even greater impact within the company.  Through this team, I've grafted in Python, TypeScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, and Docker (to name a few) into my development experience.  

**Now, I really love Python.**  I was surprised to learn that Python supports type annotations and comprehension expressions.  Both of these features are critical for functional programming.

My career has been a wild ride of constant learning, and I've got so much more to explore!
