title: Why Haskell?

I suppose I want to pursue Haskell primarily for the intellectual curiosity.  And why not?

I've heard someone once say that you should only learn a programming language if it will teach you something new.  Learning Java probably wouldn't teach me much since I already know C#.  Learning Scala probably would help much either, since I know F#.  

Python taught me a lot about systems and dynamic programming. 

I expect Haskell will teach me about *pure* functional programming.
