I like to explore new languages and technologies frequently.  This can come with the burden of constantly installing & uninstalling language packs and sdks for a particular OS I happen to be on.  

From this experience, I think it's best to install the following software for your system (Windows, Linux, or Mac).  This setup may seem heavy compared to installing a particular toolchain (such as `python`), however, the benefits will become apparent when we experiment with different toolchains.

1. Docker Desktop
   1. [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
   2. [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   3. [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
2. [VS Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. [Dev Containers VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
   - You can also install this extension through the extensions sidebar.

That's it!  From here, I will give you configuration files to spin up particular toolchains and technology stacks.
