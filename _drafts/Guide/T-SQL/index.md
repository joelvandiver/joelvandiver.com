title: Why T-SQL?

It seems to me that `T-SQL` is every where there days.  Even in stacks where we try to go `NoSQL`, we still have some semblance of `SQL` lying around.  

With its declarative nature, I would consider `T-SQL` on the easier side of software development.  But, that doesn't mean I haven't had my mind blown on numerous occasions with it.  

Also, I've seen that when I gain new insight to `T-SQL`, I am much more productive in solving business problems.

## Prerequisites

This guide will be a tutorial for writing `T-SQL` for SQL SERVER.  The variances for other platforms such as MySQL or Postgres are minimal in regards to `T-SQL`, but I'll focus on SQL SERVER here.

I'd recommend following along with one of the [SQL SERVER Quickstart Paths](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) if you do not already have a SQL SERVER instance to connect to.

I'd also recommend installing [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15) as the primary sql client to write queries.
