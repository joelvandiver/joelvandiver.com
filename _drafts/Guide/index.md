# Guides Introduction

## To Teach is To Learn

> I found the best way to learn something is to teach it.  

I thought I knew Mathematics after I graduated college, but I've never been more lost than standing in front of 30 high school students trying to teach them Algebra I.  I had already completed Cal I, II, & III, Diff. Eq., and Linear Algebra, and yet I struggled to convey basic concepts to them.  Sure, I could ace an Algebra I test - no problem - but I struggled to meet students where they were and in how they learned best. 

It took repetition in teaching and studying for me to unlock the richness of the subject so that I could meet the students where they were.  

## To Teach is To Explore

My goal in teaching is to discover new insights.  Explaining my thoughts forces me to dig deeper.  Without teaching (or in this case blogging), I would never really feel grounded in my learning day-to-day.

These guides serve as topics of interest to me over the last 10 years of my career as a software engineer.  

Enjoy!
