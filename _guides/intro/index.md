Learning programming improves problem solving.  The computer will only do what you tell it to, and if it doesn't do what you expect, then you told it incorrectly.  The skills gained through learning computer languages can help change the way that you approach problems in general.  In fact, there isn't much of a point to learning a programming language if it doesn't change the way you think.  

I've selected a few programming languages as guides through the wilderness of computer programming.

## Intended Audience

I intend to write these guides for as an introduction to programming.  You should have basic familiarity with text editors and file system management on any platform.
