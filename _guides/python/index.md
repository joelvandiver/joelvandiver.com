Even as a `dotnet` developer, I was attracted to working in Python.  With the countless `PowerShell`, `pwsh`, and `shell` scripts I had written over the years, I began looking for a language that was better suited for the modern devops stack.  Python's dynamic nature and get-it-done kind of mentality was and is very appealing to me.  

I moved to a Python stack earlier this year, and of course, I've grown to love Python for solving normal, business-oriented problems as well.  

Hopefully, through this guide, I (and you) will discover what it means to be "*Pythonic*"!
